neuron_number: 5 # The number of neuron in each population
population_number: 8 # the number of populations
stimulated_population: 3  # stimulated population (checks below for explanation)
isolated_population: [4,4] # isolated population (checks below for explanation)

# stimulated_population can be:
#        - an integer (e.g 3) --> in this case three random population will be selected to be stimulated
#        - a list (e.g ["pop_0","pop_1","pop_4"]) --> the specified population are going to be stimulated
#        - a list composed by [3,["pop_2","pop_3"]] -- > a total of three population will be stimulated and among those two are the ones specified in the list
#        - set to 0 to avoid stimulated population


#isolated_population can be: 
#        - an integer (e.g 3) --> three populations clusters will be randomly generated.
#        - a list (e.g [3,4,5]) --> three clusters will be created with 3,4,5 populations in each, respectively.
#        - a list of list (e.g [["pop_0","pop_1","pop_4"],["pop_2","pop_3"]]) --> two cluster will be generated and composed by the specified populations.
#                                                                                  Remaining population (if present) will form another cluster
#        - set to 0 to avoid isolated population

# full_inhibitory can be:
#        - an integer (e.g 3) --> in this case three random population will be selected to be fully inhibitory
#        - a list (e.g ["pop_0","pop_1","pop_4"]) --> the specified population are going to be fully inhibitory
#        - a list composed by [3,["pop_2","pop_3"]] -- > a total of three population will be fully inhibitory and among those two are the ones specified in the list
#        - set to 0 to avoid fully inhibitory population

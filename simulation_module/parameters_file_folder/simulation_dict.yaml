simulation_time: 300000 # simulation time in ms
kernel_res: 0.01 #resolution of NEST kernel
seed: 597 # seed to use
threads_num: 10 # number of threads to use in NEST computation
poisson_to_one: False

# seed: if None, a random seed will be generated. If an integer is pass that is going to be the seed
# poisson_to_one, if set to True the poisson generator will be connected to just one neuron for each population. Check the readme for explanation.

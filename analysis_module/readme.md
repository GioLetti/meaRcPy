The analysis_example jupyter notebook gives an example of the full analysis pipeline, step by step, over a simulated dataset.
I strongly suggest looking at this jupyter notebook to understand the MeaRcPy analysis workflow.

To reproduce the graphs in the paper is enough to run the script plot_final_results.py.

To run the analysis over multiple data the main.py script can be run.

Have fun!

# MeARcPy: Multielectrode Array Reservoir computing in Python

MeaRcPy is a novel software that analyzes electrophysiological multielectrode array recordings (MeA) of in-vitro neuronal networks. The model is based on the Reservoir Computer Network (Rc) architecture, which uncovers connectivity patterns among different sampled regions in the network and captures dynamic interactions between them. MeARcPy can be used to predict the network’s connectivity map and demonstrates the ability to forecast the spatio-temporal response of a given network to specific inputs.\
Moreover, MeARcPy contains a module for simulating neuronal network recordings based on numerical simulations conducted using the NEST simulator [1].\
The Rc model has been developed on top of the ReservoirPy library [2].
